It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in, we all have similar outcomes to accomplish for our businesses to thrive. We all want more appointments and conversions. We all want a boost to our repeat and referral business. We all want to save time and be more efficient. And learning how to use video email is a good place to start.
Because video puts you in front of more people in a more personal and scalable way. So, even in the most competitive on inboxes, you stand out. Why? Because real people are hard to ignore.
And in the process you’re saving time you would have otherwise spent typing by recording a quick BombBomb BombBomb video message that won’t get lost in translation. Video is simply clearer, faster, more reliable, and overall better than plain-text emails.
This is how you’ll attract potential clients and convert them into paying clients. And this is how you’ll build relationships needed to keep lifelong customers who will, in turn, refer you to others.
However, in order to see these results with video, you need to be equipped with the best strategies. So, to get you started, we’ve created Video Email Action Plans just for you.

When to Send Video Emails
When does video email make sense? The opportunities are endless. You can send video emails for everything from follow-ups and appointment confirmations to even birthdays and anniversaries.
But it’s important to know how to use video email at the right time. Three of the best ways to use video email include:
1. Initial Lead Response
There’s no better way to make a good first impression than in person. And video allows you to introduce yourself face to face in a scalable manner. There are three things you should always keep in mind when responding to your leads:
• Make it personal: Let people know that you are invested in them by keeping your video personal. You can do this by kicking off your video with a whiteboard that says their name or has their company logo on it.
• Follow the structure (Empathize, Value, Call to Action): Show a little empathy for your recipients’ thoughts and concerns and explain the value you have to offer. Then, finish your message off with a clear Call to Action elaborating on exactly what you want them to do.
• Keep it short: You don’t know these leads yet. Show them you value their time by keeping your video under one minute long. Keep your message concise and to-the-point.

2. Thank You
If you want to keep customers for life and garner referrals, you need to maintain relationships with your past clients and referral partners. And to do that, expressing gratitude is essential.
So, send a thank you video to each person for their business, as well as the referrals they send your way. And be sure to do the following in your BombBomb BombBomb video message:
• Start off with a thank you: Begin your BombBomb BombBomb video message with gratitude. Thank your recipients for their business, as well as the referral business they’re sending your way.
• Remember what about the relationship you are thankful for: Tell your recipients what you’re grateful for, and make that the focus of your BombBomb BombBomb video message.
• Don’t ruin it by asking for business at the end: Do not close your video email by asking someone for business. Your message will come across as insincere.
